                                Shinoda's band brought in second vocalist Chester Bennington, replacing Mark Wakefield.
                                From the onset, Shinoda was closely involved in the technical aspects of the band's
                                recordings, and over the subsequent releases that role continued to expand. Shinoda,
                                with guitarist Brad Delson, engineered and produced the band's Hybrid Theory EP, and
                                performed similar roles in the recording of the Hybrid Theory album. Mike executively
                                organized and oversaw the band's remix album Reanimation (2002), contributing his own
                                production remixes that he made in his home studio for "Crawling" and "Pushing Me Away."
                                In his spare time, he produced and performed on a song by The X-Ecutioners entitled

                                        (2006) with Jay-Z and Paul McCartney, which was an homage to Danger Mouse’s
                                        “Grey Album.” They also won “Best Rap Sung Collaboration” the same night. As
                                        they walked up to the podium, Jay motioned for Mike to give the acceptance
                                        speech, which he did. We think Jay wanted him to accept because he had
                                        assembled, produced, and mixed all the mashups on Collision Course.

                            Delson graduated from Agoura High School in 1995 and formed Xero with Mike Shinoda whom
                            he knew since the seventh grade, which would later become Linkin Park. He graduated from
                            the University of California, Los Angeles with a degree in communications, but decided
                            to forgo law school to pursue a career with Linkin Park.

                            While in college, (he shared a college room with Dave Farrell) Delson had to intern with a
                            member of the music industry as a part of his career. He ended up working for Jeff Blue, an
                            A&R representative at Warner Bros. Records. He told Blue about his band and in return for
                            giving him demos to listen to he was offered constructive criticism. Blue is the man who
                            found Linkin Park's current lead vocalist, Chester Bennington.

                            He also used to work as a bouncer at the Roxy, as confirmed by the breakfast with Linkin

                            Before forming Xero with Mark Wakefield, Delson's first instrument was the clarinet. His
                            first band was called the Pricks, and he later played in a band called Relative Degree with
                            his fellow Linkin Park bandmate Rob Bourdon. He met and roomed with bandmate Dave Farrell,
                            better known as Phoenix, at UCLA.

                            Delson can usually be seen wearing a very large pair of headphones on stage. The headphones
                            are designed by Shinoda and himself and change with every Linkin Park release. Delson has
                            alluded to an exact reason for them, but he has admitted it channels him into his own
                            personal "matrix" while performing. He won't divulge to what this "matrix" is in detail.
                            Delson usually does not give a serious answer as to why he wears the headphones, with
                            answers such as "If I tell you, I'll have to have sex with you." In a recent interview, Mike
                            Shinoda said that Brad wears shooting range headphones for hearing protection. Then he gives
                            them to Mike who then makes sticker designs which go on them.

                            Delson has been known for his anti-social behavior on occasions. In high school, he used to
                            dye his hair a variety of colors and in earlier days of the band he generally kept it
                            shaved. Recently, Delson has been seen sporting an Afro, which is also seen on the front
                            cover for Minutes to Midnight.

                            Farrell was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts but later moved to Mission Viejo, California
                            when he was five. He attended Mission Viejo High School. He also graduated from the
                            University of California, Los Angeles, in 1999. He is adept at playing the bass guitar,
                            electric guitar, cello and violin. He has also been known to play an upright bass at some
                            concerts.

                            Farrell was a member of a Christian ska/Christian punk band known as Tasty Snax. While
                            attending college, he would practice with Brad Delson in their dorm room together. However,
                            because he had to play and tour with the Tasty Snax, he could not play with Brad Delson and
                            his band, which would become Linkin Park . After changing their name to Snax, Farrell began
                            playing bass guitar in the band before leaving once again to join Linkin Park full-time to
                            play bass. Farrell's fellow band mate Mark Fiore became Linkin Park's videographer. As
                            described in the inlay for Reanimation he uses an Ernie Ball MusicMan Bass.

                                Hahn joined Linkin Park, after meeting fellow band mate Mike Shinoda in art school, when

                                music videos for Linkin Park, with the exceptions of "One Step Closer", "Crawling",
                                "Faint", and "Given Up". However, he came up with the idea for "One Step Closer" and
                                collaborated with Mark Fiore and fellow band members to direct "Given Up". He is
                                referenced to as Mr. Hahn at the beginning of "Cure for the Itch" from Hybrid Theory as
                                well as in "High Voltage" from Hybrid Theory EP and "Kyur4 TH Ich" from Reanimation. He
                                has also remixed the band's songs "With You" and "Cure for the Itch" (originally on
                                "Hybrid Theory"), which appear on the remix album Reanimation as "Wth>You" and "Kyur4 Th

                                wit in most interviews. Hahn is also a Transformers fan—on various occasions he has worn
                                clothing or used turntables with Decepticon symbols on them. He was also the one to
                                advise the band to put the single "What I've Done" on the soundtrack for the
                                Transformers live action movie. Hahn, along with Rob and Chester, were present at the

                                    Bourdon wears Puma racing shoes to get a better feel for the drum pedals; he says it
                                    gives him better control of the pedals. He is said to be somewhat of a
                                    perfectionist. Rob's hobbies include playing the piano (although he has never done
                                    so for a Linkin Park recording) and surfing.

                                    In Linkin Park's third studio album, Minutes to Midnight, Rob has used standard

                                    albums. Photos of the drum machines to be used for the record have surfaced via Joe

                                    In live performances of "Bleed It Out" Rob regularly plays a 'Jungle' complex drum

                                    in, but continued to play as breaking the tip doesn't actually impair his

                                Bennington was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and this is where he first met Christy Morris.
                                He took interest in music at a young age, citing Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as
                                early inspirations. Bennington's parents separated in the late 1980s. He later struggled
                                with cocaine and methamphetamine addictions. Bennington eventually overcame his drug
                                addiction, and would go on to denounce drug use in future interviews. He worked at a
                                Burger King restaurant before starting his career as a professional musician.

                                Before joining Linkin Park, Bennington was a vocalist in Grey Daze, a post-grunge band
                                from Phoenix, Arizona. He left Grey Daze in 1998, but struggled to find another band to
                                play in. After nearly quitting his musical career altogether, Jeff Blue, then the vice
                                president of A&R at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered Bennington an audition with the
                                future members of Linkin Park. Bennington quit his day job, and took his family to
                                California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park, who were then called
                                "Xero". Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band’s other vocalist, made significant
                                progress together, but failed to find a record deal. After facing numerous rejections,
                                Jeff Blue, now a vice president of A&R at Warner Bros., intervened again to help the
                                band sign with Warner Bros. Records.

                                On October 24, 2000 Linkin Park released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, through
                                Warner Bros. Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to Hybrid Theory based on
                                some early material.

                                Hybrid Theory was released in the United States on October 24, 2000 following the debut
                                of "One Step Closer" on the radio. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 charts at #16 in
                                late 2000, and was certified gold by the RIAA five weeks after its release. In 2001,
                                Hybrid Theory sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling
                                album of the year, and it was estimated that the album continued selling 100, 000 copies
                                per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to sell at a
                                fast pace and was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 for selling 10 million copies in
                                the U.S.[13] It has sold 29 million copies worldwide as of 2009, which makes it the
                                band's best-selling album and the best-selling debut album of the 21st century.

                                The follow up to Hybrid Theory would ultimately become Meteora. The band began to work
                                on new material amidst their saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in
                                their tour bus' studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio
                                album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of
                                Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks.
                                Meteora featured a mixture of the band's previous nu metal and rapcore styles with newer
                                innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of
                                bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003, and
                                instantly earned worldwide recognition, going to #1 in the US and UK, and #2 in
                                Australia.

                                Linkin Park returned to the recording studios in 2006 to work on new material. To
                                produce the album, the band chose producer, Rick Rubin. Despite initially stating the
                                album would debut sometime in 2006, the album was delayed until 2007. The band had
                                recorded thirty to fifty songs in August 2006, when Shinoda stated the album was halfway
                                completed.Bennington later added that the new album would stray away from their previous
                                nu metal sound.Warner Bros. Records officially announced that the band’s third studio
                                album, entitled Minutes to Midnight, would be released on May 15, 2007, in the United
                                States. After spending fourteen months working on the album, the band opted to further
                                refine their album by removing five of the original seventeen tracks. The album’s title,
                                a reference to the Doomsday Clock, foreshadowed the band's new lyrical themes. Minutes
                                to Midnight sold over 600,000 copies in its first week, making it one of the most
                                successful debut week albums in recent years. The album also took the top spot on the
                                Billboard Charts.

                                In an interview with Q101's Kevin Manno at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, Bennington
                                stated Linkin Park will be returning to the studio sometime in November to begin
                                recording for their next album. This album, A Thousand Suns, was released in September
                                2010. Seen by many as a radical departure from the nu metal genre the band became known
                                for, much of the album has an experimental quality to it. Later on the band released
                                LIVING THINGS their 5th album. After LIVING THINGS the band went back to their roots
                                with “The Hunting Party” which did much better than LIVING THINGS. After that their last
                                album One More Light was released.

                                Despite having prodigious success in the early 2000s, Bennington had medical issues
                                outside of the limelight. He suffered a severe bite from a recluse spider while touring
                                with the OzzFest in 2001. Bennington was plagued with poor health during the making of
                                Meteora, and struggled to attend some of the album’s recording sessions. He fell ill
                                during the summer of 2003, and eventually underwent surgery. Bennington sustained a
                                wrist injury in October 2007 while attempting to jump off a platform during a show in
                                Melbourne, Australia. Despite the injury, he continued to perform, and went to the
                                emergency room after the show. Recently, he sustained a back injury while slipping a
                                plate in his back while playing with his kids. His doctor has confirmed that he was no
                                longer able to jump off platforms during shows.

                                On July 20, 2017, Chester was found dead at his home by suicide by hanging. His death
                                was on the same day as what would have been his late friend, Chris Cornell's 53rd
                                birthday. Chris Cornell had also died of hanging himself two months prior. Everyone was
                                in shock when this happened. On October 27th Linkin Park and other artists joined
                                together at the Hollywood Bowl live-streaming a concert “celebrating“ Chester’s life. To
                                this day almost no activity has come from any of the band members except, Mike Shinoda
                                who released a EP entitled “Post Traumatic EP”<br>

                                Chester Bennington teamed up with original Orgy guitarists Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh,
                                who perform together as Julien-K, for a solo project. Chester's band is called Dead By
                                Sunrise, formerly known as Snow White Tan. Dead By Sunrise released their debut album in
                                2009. The album is called Out of Ashes. "Both bands are the same. The one where Chester
                                sings and writes is Dead By Sunrise, but when I sing, and Amir and I are the primary
                                writers, it becomes Julien-K and it's more electro and much darker...Julien-K and Dead
                                by Sunrise are basically a creative collective, we're sort of a Warhol-style factory in
                                that sense," explains Ryan Shuck. "Dead by Sunrise is Chester's Julien-K if that makes
                                any sense."

                            Mark Wakefield is the manager for the band Taproot, and is the former singer of Xero, the
                            band that eventually became Linkin Park. He met Mike Shinoda in high school and joined the
                            band, who were at that point called SuperXero. They revised the name to Xero and recorded
                            the self-titled Xero sampler tape /their first EP featuring the songs, "Fuse", "Reading My
                            Eyes", "Stick N' Move" and "Rhinestone".

                            Before quitting the band Mark and the rest of Xero are known to have played at least one
                            concert as an opening act for Cypress Hill. The lack of success and stalemate in progress
                            prompted Wakefield, at that time the band’s vocalist, to leave the band in search of other
                            projects. Chester Bennington had replaced him until his untimely death by suicide by hanging
                            on July 20, 2017.

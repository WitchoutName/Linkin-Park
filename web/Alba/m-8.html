              Nothing ever stops all these thoughts <br>
              And the pain attached to them <br>
              Sometimes I wonder why this is happening <br>
              It's like nothing I can do would distract me when <br>
              I think of how I shot myself in the back again <br>
              ‘Cause from the infinite words I can say I <br>
              Put all pain you gave to me on display <br>
              But didn't realize instead of setting it free I <br>
              Took what I hated and made it a part of me <br>
              <br>
              [It never goes away] <br>
              [It never goes away] <br>
              <br>
              And now <br>
              You've become a part of me <br>
              You'll always be right here <br>
              You've become a part of me <br>
              You'll always be my fear <br>
              I can't separate <br>
              Myself from what I've done <br>
              Giving up a part of me <br>
              I've let myself become you <br>
              <br>
              Hearing your name <br>
              The memories come back again <br>
              I remember when it started happening <br>
              I'd see you in every thought I had and then <br>
              My thoughts slowly found words attached to them <br>
              And I knew as they escaped away I was <br>
              Committing myself to 'em <br>
              And every day <br>
              I regret saying those things <br>
              Cause now I see that I <br>
              Took what I hated and made it apart of me <br>
              <br>
              [It never goes away] [It never goes away] <br>
              And now <br>
              You've become a part of me <br>
              You'll always be right here <br>
              You've become a part of me <br>
              You'll always be my fear <br>
              I can't separate <br>
              Myself from what I've done <br>
              Giving up a part of me <br>
              I've let myself become you <br>
              [It never goes away] <br>
              [It never goes away] <br>
              [It never goes away] <br>
              [It never goes away] <br>
              <br>
              Get away from ME! <br>
              Give me my space back <br>
              You gotta just GO! <br>
              Everything comes down to memories of YOU! <br>
              I've kept it in but now I’m letting you KNOW! <br>
              I've let you go! <br>
              <br>
              So get away from ME! <br>
              Give me my space back <br>
              You gotta just GO! <br>
              Everything comes down to memories of YOU! <br>
              I've kept it in but now I’m letting you KNOW! <br>
              I've let you go! <br>
              <br>
              And now <br>
              <br>
              You've become a part of me <br>
              You'll always be right here <br>
              You've become a part of me <br>
              You'll always be my fear <br>
              I can't separate <br>
              Myself from what I've done <br>
              Giving up a part of me <br>
              I've let myself become you <br>
              I've let myself become you <br>
              I've let myself become  <br>
              Lost inside these thoughts of you <br>
              Giving up a part of me <br>
              I've let myself become you <br>

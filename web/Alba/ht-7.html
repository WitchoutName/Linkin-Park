              What do I do to ignore them behind me <br>
              Do I follow my instincts blindly <br>
              Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams <br>
              And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening <br>
              Do I sit here and try to stand it <br>
              Or do I try to catch them red-handed <br>
              To I trust some and get fooled by phoniness <br>
              Or do I trust nobody and live in lonliness <br>
              Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin <br>
              I make the right moves but I'm lost within <br>
              I put on my daily facade but then <br>
              I just end up getting hurt again <br>
              By myself <br>
              (Myself) <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              I ask why <br>
              (But in my mind I find) <br>
              I can't rely on myself <br>
              (Myself) <br>
              I ask why <br>
              (But in my mind I find) <br>
              I can't rely on myself <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              I can't hold on <br>
              (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) <br>
              It's all too much to take in <br>
              I can't hold on <br>
              (To anything, watching everything spin) <br>
              With thoughts of failure sinking in <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              If I turn my back, I'm defenseless <br>
              And to go blindly seem senseless <br>
              If I hide my pride and let it all go on <br>
              Then they'll take from me till everything is gone <br>
              If I let them go, I'll be outdone <br>
              But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun <br>
              If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer <br>
              Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer <br>
              By myself <br>
              (Myself) <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              I ask why <br>
              (But in my mind I find) <br>

              How do you think <br>
              I've lost so much <br>
              I'm so afraid <br>
              I'm out of touch <br>
              How do you expect <br>
              I will know what to do <br>
              When all I know <br>
              Is what you tell me to <br>

              No matter what I do, how hard I (try) <br>
              I can't seem to convince myself (why) <br>
              I'm stuck on the outside <br>

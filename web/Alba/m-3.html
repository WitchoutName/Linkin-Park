          <p>
              When this began <br>
              I had nothing to say <br>
              And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me <br>
              I was confused <br>
              And I let it all out to find / that I'm <br>
              Not the only person with these things in mind <br>
              Inside of me <br>
              But all the vacancy the words revealed <br>
              Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel <br>
              Nothing to lose <br>
              Just stuck / Hollow and alone <br>
              And the fault is my own <br>
              And the fault is my own <br>
              <br>
              I want to heal <br>
              I want to feel <br>
              What I thought was never real <br>
              I want to let go of the pain I've held so long <br>
              [Erase all the pain 'til it's gone] <br>
              I want to heal <br>
              I want to feel <br>
              Like I'm close to something real <br>
              I want to find something I've wanted all along <br>
              Somewhere i belong <br>
              <br>
              And I've got nothing to say <br>
              I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face <br>
              I was confused <br>
              Looking everywhere / only to find that it's <br>
              Not the way i had imagined it all in my mind <br>
              So what am I <br>
              What do I have but negativity <br>
              'Cause i can't justify the <br>
              Way everyone is looking at me
              Nothing to lose <br>
              Nothing to gain / Hollow and alone <br>
              And the fault is my own <br>
              The fault is my own <br>
              <br>
              I want to heal <br>
              I want to feel <br>
              What I thought was never real <br>
              I want to let go of the pain I've held so long <br>
              [Erase all the pain 'til it's gone] <br>
              I want to heal <br>
              I want to feel <br>
              Like I'm close to something real <br>
              I want to find something I've wanted all along <br>
              Somewhere i belong <br>
              <br>
              I will never know <br>
              Myself until I do this on my own <br>
              And I will never feel <br>
              Anything else until my wounds are healed <br>
              I will never be <br>
              Anything 'til I break away from me <br>
              And I will break away <br>
              I'll find myself today <br>
              <br>
              I want to heal <br>
              I want to feel <br>
              What I thought was never real <br>
              I want to let go of the pain I've held so long <br>
              [Erase all the pain 'til it's gone] <br>
              I want to heal <br>
              I want to feel <br>
              Like I'm close to something real <br>
              I want to find something I've wanted all along <br>
              <br>
              Somewhere I belong <br>

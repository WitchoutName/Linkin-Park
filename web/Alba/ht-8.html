              It starts with... <br>
              One thing / I don't know why <br>
              It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
              Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme <br>
              To explain in due time <br>
              All I know... <br>
              Time is a valuable thing <br>
              Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <br>
              Watch it count down to the end of the day <br>
              The clock ticks life away <br>
              It's so unreal... <br>
              Didn't look out below <br>
              Watch the time go right out the window <br>
              Trying to hold on / but didn't even know <br>
              Wasted it all just to <br>
              Watch you go... <br>
              I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart <br>
              What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when <br>
              <br>
              I tried so hard <br>
              And got so far <br>
              But in the end <br>
              It doesn't even matter <br>
              I had to fall <br>
              And lose it all <br>
              But in the end <br>
              It doesn't even matter <br>
              <br>
              One thing / I don't know why <br>
              Doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
              Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme <br>
              To remind myself how <br>
              I tried so hard... <br>
              In spite of the way you were mocking me <br>
              Acting like I was part of your property <br>
              Remembering all the times you fought with me / I'm surprised <br>
              It got so far... <br>
              Things aren't the way they were before <br>
              You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <br>
              Not that you knew me back then <br>
              But it all comes back to me <br>
              In the end.. <br>
              You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart <br>
              What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I <br>
              <br>
              I tried so hard <br>
              And got so far <br>

              It doesn't even matter <br>
              <br>
              I put my trust in you <br>
              Pushed as far as I can go <br>
              And for all this <br>
              There's only one thing you should know... <br>
              <br>
              I put my trust in you! <br>
              Pushed as far as I can go! <br>
              And for all this! <br>
              There's only one thing you should know <br>
              <br>
              I tried so hard <br>

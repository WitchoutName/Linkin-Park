          <p>
            I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night <br>
            Shining with the light from the sun <br>
            The sun doesn't give life to the moon assuming <br>
            The moon's gonna owe it one <br>
            It makes me think of how you act to me / you do <br>
            Favors and then rapidly / you just <br>
            Turn around and start asking me / about <br>
            Things that you want back from me <br>
            <br>
            I'm sick of the tension / sick of the hunger <br>
            Sick of you acting like I owe you this <br>
            Find another place / to feed your greed <br>
            While I find a place to rest <br>
            <br>
            I want to be in another place <br>
            I hate when you say you don't understand <br>
            [You'll see it's not meant to be] <br>
            I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy <br>
            A place for my head <br>

            Maybe someday I'll be just like you / and <br>
            Step on people like you do and <br>
            Run away the people I thought I knew <br>
            I remember back then who you were <br>
            You used to be calm / used to be strong <br>
            Used to be generous / but you should've known <br>
            That you'd <br>
            Wear out your welcome, and now you see <br>
            How quiet it is, all alone <br>
            <br>
            I'm so sick of the tension / sick of the hunger <br>
            Sick of you acting like I owe you this <br>
            Find another place / to feed your greed <br>
            While / I find a place to rest <br>
            <br>
            I'm so sick of the tension / sick of the hunger <br>
            Sick of you acting like I owe you this <br>
            Find another place / to feed your greed <br>
            While / I find a place to rest <br>
            <br>
            I want to be in another place <br>
            I hate when you say you don't understand <br>

            A place for my head <br>
            <br>
            You try to take the best of me <br>
            Go away <br>
            You try to take the best of me <br>
            Go away <br>

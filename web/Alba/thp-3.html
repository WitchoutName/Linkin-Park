              Tell us all again <br>
              What you think we should be <br>
              What the answers are <br>
              What it is we can't see <br>
              Tell us all again <br>
              How to do what you say <br>
              How to fall in line <br>
              How there's no other way <br>
              But oh / we all now <br>
              <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              Too sick to be ashamed <br>
              You want to point your finger <br>
              But there's no one else to blame <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              Too sick to be ashamed <br>
              You want to point your finger <br>
              But there's no one else to blame <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              <br>
              Show us all again <br>
              That our hands are unclean <br>
              That we're unprepared <br>
              That you have what we need <br>
              Show us all again <br>
              'Cause we cannot be saved <br>
              'Cause the end is near <br>
              Now there's no other way <br>
              But oh / we all know <br>
              <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              Too sick to be ashamed <br>
              You want to point your finger <br>
              But there's no one else to blame <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              Too sick to be ashamed <br>
              You want to point your finger <br>
              But there's no one else to blame <br>
              <br>
              There's no one else to blame <br>
              <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the...) <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the...) <br>
              You're guilty all the same..! <br>
              <br>
              Yeah, you already know what it is <br>
              Can y'all explain what kind of land is this <br>
              When a man has plans for being rich <br>
              But the bosses plans is wealthy <br>
              Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonesense <br>
              It's insane <br>
              Even corporate hands is filthy <br>
              They talk team and take the paper route <br>
              All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty <br>
              At anybody's expense <br>
              No shame with a clear conscience <br>
              No regrets and guilt free <br>
              They claim that ain't the way that they built me <br>
              The smoke screen before the flame <br>
              Knowing as good as the dough or the deal peak <br>
              They say it's time for things to change <br>
              Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap <br>
              Anything if it's more to gain <br>
              Drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep <br>
              Until no more remains <br>
              But I'm still me <br>
              Like authentic hip-hop and rock <br>
              Til pop and radio and record companies kill me <br>
              Try to force me to stray and obey <br>
              And got the gall to say how real can real be <br>
              You feel me we'll see that green could be to blame <br>
              Or greedy for the fame <br>
              TV or a name <br>
              The media, the game <br>
              To me you're all the same <br>
              You're guilty <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              (You're guilty) <br>
              <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              Too sick to be ashamed <br>
              You want to point your finger <br>
              But there's no one else to blame <br>
              You're guilty all the same <br>
              Too sick to be ashamed <br>
              You want to point your finger <br>
              But there's no one else to blame <br>
              <br>
              There's no one else to blame! <br>
              <br>
              Guilty all the same <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the...) <br>
              Guilty all the same <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the same) <br>
              (...all the...) <br>

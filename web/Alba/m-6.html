              It's easier to run <br>
              Replacing this pain with something numb <br>
              It's so much easier to go <br>
              Than face all this pain here all alone <br>
              <br>
              Something has been taken <br>
              From deep inside of me <br>
              A secret I've kept locked away <br>
              No one can ever see <br>
              Wounds so deep they never show <br>
              They never go away <br>
              Like moving pictures in my head <br>
              For years and years they've played <br>
              <br>
              If I could change I would <br>
              Take back the pain I would <br>
              Retrace every wrong move that I made I would <br>
              If I could <br>
              Stand up and take the blame I would <br>
              If I could take all the shame to the grave I would <br>
              If I could change I would <br>
              Take back the pain I would <br>
              Retrace every wrong move that I made I would <br>
              If I could <br>
              Stand up and take the blame I would <br>
              If I could take all the shame to the grave I would <br>
              <br>
              It's easier to run <br>
              Replacing this pain with something numb <br>
              It's so much easier to go <br>
              Than face all this pain here all alone <br>
              <br>
              Sometimes I remember <br>
              The darkness of my past <br>
              Bringing back these memories <br>
              I wish I didn't have <br>
              Sometimes I think of letting go <br>
              And never looking back <br>
              And never moving forward so <br>
              There would never be a past <br>
              <br>
              If I could change I would <br>
              Take back the pain I would <br>
              Retrace every wrong move that I made I would <br>
              If I could <br>
              Stand up and take the blame I would <br>
              If I could take all the shame to the grave I would <br>
              If I could change I would <br>
              Take back the pain I would <br>
              Retrace every wrong move that I made I would <br>
              If I could <br>
              Stand up and take the blame I would <br>
              If I could take all the shame to the grave <br>
              <br>
              Just washing it aside <br>
              All of the helplessness inside <br>
              Pretending I don't feel misplaced <br>
              Is so much simpler than change <br>
              <br>
              It's easier to run <br>
              Replacing this pain with something numb <br>
              It's so much easier to go <br>
              Than face all this pain here all alone <br>
              It's easier to run <br>
              If I could change I would <br>
              Take back the pain I would <br>
              Retrace every wrong move that I made <br>
              It's easier to go <br>
              If I could change I would <br>
              Take back the pain I would <br>
              Retrace every wrong move that I made I would <br>
              If I could <br>
              Stand up and take the blame I would <br>
              I would take all my shame to the grave <br>

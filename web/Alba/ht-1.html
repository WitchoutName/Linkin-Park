          <p>
            Why does it feel like night today? <br>
            Something in here's not right today <br>
            Why am I so uptight today? <br>
            Paranoia's all I got left <br>
            I don't know what stressed me first <br>
            Or how the pressure was fed / but <br>
            I know just what it feels like <br>
            To have a voice in the back of my head <br>
            It's like a face that I hold inside <br>
            A face that awakes when I close my eyes <br>
            A face watches every time I lie <br>
            A face that laughs every time I fall <br>
            [And watches everything] <br>
            So I know that when it's time to sink or swim <br>
            That the face inside is hearing me / right underneath my skin <br>
            <br>
            It's like I'm / paranoid lookin' over my back <br>
            It's like a / whirlwind inside of my head <br>
            It's like I / can't stop what I'm hearing within <br>
            It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin <br>
            <br>
            I know I've got a face in me <br>
            Points out all my mistakes to me <br>
            You've got a face on the inside too and <br>
            Your paranoia's probably worse <br>
            I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand <br>
            Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is <br>
            I can't add up to what you can <br>
            But everybody has a face that they hold inside <br>
            A face that awakes when they close their eyes <br>
            A face watches every time they lie <br>
            A face that laughs every time they fall <br>
            [And watches everything] <br>
            So you know that when it's time to sink or swim <br>
            That the face inside is watching you too / right inside your skin <br>
            <br>
            It's like I'm / paranoid lookin' over my back <br>
            It's like a / whirlwind inside of my head <br>
            It's like I / can't stop what I'm hearing within <br>
            It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin <br>
            <br>
            It's like I'm / paranoid lookin' over my back <br>

            It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin <br>
            <br>
            The face inside is right beneath your skin <br>
            The face inside is right beneath your skin <br>
            The face inside is right beneath your skin <br>
            <br>
            The sun goes down <br>
            I feel the light betray me <br>

          <p>
            Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something <br>
            Lightweights steppin' aside when we come in <br>
            Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping <br>
            People on the street then panic and start running <br>
            Words on loose leaf sheet, complete coming <br>
            I jump in my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumping <br>
            Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in <br>
            Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming <br>
            Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping <br>
            Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping <br>
            List something, take back what's yours <br>
            Say something that you know they might attack you for <br>
            'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before <br>
            Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for <br>
            Like this war's really just a different brand of war <br>
            Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor <br>
            Like they understand you, in the back of their jet <br>
            When you can't put gas in your tank, these fuckers <br>
            Are laughing their way to the bank, and cashing their check <br>
            Asking you to have the passion and have some respect <br>
            For a leader so nervous in an obvious way <br>
            Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay <br>
            And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day <br>
            In the living room, laughing like, "What did he say?" <br>
            <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            <br>
            In my living room watching it, I am not laughing <br>
            'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen <br>
            The world is cold, the bold men take action <br>
            Have to react to get blown into fractions <br>
            At 10 years old, it's something to see <br>
            Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep <br>
            Taken and bound and found later under a tree <br>
            I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me' <br>
            Do you see the soldiers that are out today? <br>
            They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away <br>
            It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray <br>
            But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday <br>
            There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads <br>
            Inside your market, your shops, and your clothes <br>
            My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know <br>
            But enough pride inside not to let that show <br>
            My brother had a book he would hold with pride <br>
            A little red cover with a broken spine on the back <br>
            He hand-wrote a quote inside, <br>
            "When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die" <br>
            Meanwhile, the leader just talks away <br>
            Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay <br>
            The rest of the world watching at the end of the day <br>
            Both scared and angry, like "What did he say?" <br>
            <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            Amen <br>
            <br>
            With hands held high into a sky so blue <br>
            The ocean opens up to swallow you <br>
            With hands held high into a sky so blue <br>
            The ocean opens up to swallow you <br>
            With hands held high into a sky so blue <br>
            The ocean opens up to swallow you <br>
            With hands held high into a sky so blue <br>
            The ocean opens up to swallow you <br>
            With hands held high into a sky so blue <br>
            The ocean opens up to swallow you <br>

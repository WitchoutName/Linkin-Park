          <p>
              Today <br>
              We stood on the wall <br>
              We laughed at the Sun <br>
              We laughed at the guns <br>
              We laughed at it all <br>
              And when they <br>
              They told us to go <br>
              We paid them no mind <br>
              Like every other time <br>
              But little did we know <br>
              <br>
              Today <br>
              We looked for a sign <br>
              With flames in my hands <br>
              A line in the sand <br>
              Between yours and mine <br>
              And it came <br>
              Like fire from below <br>
              Your greed led the call <br>
              My flag had to fall <br>
              But little did you know <br>
              <br>
              Another day / your truth will come <br>
              You're gonna pay for what you <br>
              Pay for what you've done <br>
              You'll get what's yours / and face your crime <br>
              You'll tell them give me back what's mine <br>
              Give me back what's mine <br>
              I had never been a coward <br>
              I've never seen blood <br>
              You had sold me an ocean <br>
              And I was lost in the flood <br>
              We were counting on a leader <br>
              We were driven by need <br>
              But couldn't take temptation <br>
              And we were blinded by greed <br>
              You were steady as a sniper <br>
              We were waiting on a wire <br>
              So we never saw it coming <br>
              When you ran from the fire <br>
              You can try intimidation <br>
              And you can try to ignore <br>
              But when the time comes calling, yeah <br>
              You are gonna get yours <br>
              <br>
              Another day / your truth will come <br>
              You're gonna pay for what you <br>
              Pay for what you've done <br>
              You'll get what's yours / and face your crime <br>
              You'll tell them give me back what's mine <br>
              Give me back what's mine <br>
              And so today / your truth has come <br>
              You're gonna pay for what you <br>
              Pay for what you've done <br>
              You'll get what's yours / you're out of time <br>
              And you will give me back what's mine <br>
              Give me back what's mine <br>
              Give me, give me back what's mine <br>
              Give me, give me back what's mine <br>
              What's mine <br>
              Give me, give me back what's mine <br>
              What's mine <br>
              What's mine <br>
              Give me back what's mine <br>
              <br>
              Today <br>
              We stood on the wall <br>
              We laughed at the Sun <br>
              We laughed at the guns <br>
              We laughed at it all <br>
              And when they <br>

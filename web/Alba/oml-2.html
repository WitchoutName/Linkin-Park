            So say goodbye and hit the road <br>
            Pack it up and disappear <br>
            You better have some place to go <br>
            'Cause you can't come back around here <br>
            Good goodbye <br>
            (Don't you come back no more) <br>
            <br>
            Live from the rhythm, it's <br>
            Something wild, venomous <br>
            Enemies trying to read me <br>
            You're all looking highly illiterate <br>
            Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix <br>
            You won't find an equivalent <br>
            I've been here killing it <br>
            Longer than you've been alive, you idiot <br>
            And it makes you so mad <br>
            Somebody else could be stepping in front of you <br>
            And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one <br>
            There's more than one of you <br>
            And you can't understand the fact <br>
            That it's over and done, hope you had fun <br>
            You've got a lot to discuss on the bus <br>
            Headed back where you're from <br>
            <br>
            So say goodbye and hit the road <br>
            Pack it up and disappear <br>
            You better have some place to go <br>
            'Cause you can't come back around here <br>
            Good goodbye <br>
            (Don't you come back no more) <br>
            <br>
            Goodbye, good riddance <br>
            A period is after every sentence <br>
            Did my time with my cellmate <br>
            Maxed out so now we finished <br>
            Every day was like a hail date <br>
            Every night was like a hailstorm <br>
            Took her back to my tinted windows <br>
            Showin' out, she in rare form <br>
            Wings up, now I'm airborne <br>
            King Push, they got a chair for him <br>
            Make way for the new queen <br>
            The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em <br>
            Consequence when you ain't there for him <br>
            Were you there for him? <br>
            Did you care for him? <br>
            You were dead wrong <br>
            <br>
            So say goodbye and hit the road <br>
            Pack it up and disappear <br>
            You better have some place to go <br>
            'Cause you can't come back around here <br>
            Good goodbye <br>
            (Don't you come back no more) <br>
            <br>
            Let me say goodbye to my demons <br>
            Let me say goodbye to my past life <br>
            Let me say goodbye to the darkness <br>
            Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight <br>
            Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me <br>
            Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life <br>
            And I still keep raising the bar like <br>
            Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice <br>
            Goodbye to the stereotypes <br>
            You can't tell my kings we can't <br>
            Mandem we're linking tings in parks <br>
            Now I gotta tune with Linkin Park <br>
            Like goodbye to my old hoe’s <br>
            Goodbye to the cold roads <br>
            I can't die for my postcode <br>
            Young little Mike from the Gold Coast <br>
            And now I'm inside with my bro bro's <br>
            Gang <br>
            <br>
            So say goodbye and hit the road <br>
            Pack it up and disappear <br>
            You better have some place to go <br>
            'Cause you can't come back around here <br>
            Good goodbye <br>
            (Don't you come back no more) <br>

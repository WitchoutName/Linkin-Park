            Let me apologize to begin with <br>
            Let me apologize for what I'm about to say <br>
            But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed <br>
            And somehow I got caught up in between <br>
            <br>
            Let me apologize to begin with <br>
            Let me apologize for what I'm about to say <br>
            But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed <br>
            And somehow I got caught up in between <br>
            <br>
            Between my pride and my promise <br>
            Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way <br>
            The things I want to say to you get lost before they come <br>
            The only thing that's worse than one is none <br>
            <br>
            Let me apologize to begin with <br>
            Let me apologize for what I'm about to say <br>
            But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed <br>
            And somehow I got caught up in between <br>
            <br>
            Between my pride and my promise <br>
            Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way <br>
            The things I want to say to you get lost before they come <br>
            The only thing that's worse than one is none <br>
            The only thing that's worse than one is none <br>
            <br>
            And I cannot explain to you <br>
            In anything I say or do or plan <br>
            Fear is not afraid of you <br>
            But guilt's a language you can understand <br>
            <br>
            I cannot explain to you <br>
            In anything I say or do <br>
            But hope the actions speak the words they can <br>
            <br>
            For my pride and my promise <br>
            For my lies and how the truth gets in the way <br>
            The things I want to say to you get lost before they come <br>
            The only thing that's worse than one is <br>
            <br>
            Pride and my promise <br>
            Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way <br>
            The things I want to say to you get lost before they come <br>
            The only thing that's worse than one is none <br>
            The only thing that's worse than one is none <br>
